I think I read this in F5 and this is probably the most influential book to me in my life so far. Again I think the author is a Professor in Stanford so it's actual real psychology backed by research and not just some motivational BS videos on youtube etc. It basically teaches me to be resilient and not to give up easily on things that I am not good at. Trust me you gonna need it coz there will be so many things you felt incompetent starting uni (how you deal with that feeling is what this book is about).

I think this is my first Non-Fiction book when I started reading in F5. Glad I picked this one.
