I think I read this in F5 and this is probably the most influential book to me. Again I think the author is a Prof in Stanford Uni so it's actual real psychology backed by research not just some motivational BS videos on youtube etc. It basically teaches me to be resilient and not give up easily on things that I am not good at. Trust me you gonna need it coz there will be so many things you felt incompetent starting uni.

I think this is my first Non-Fiction book when I started reading in F5. Glad I picked this one.
