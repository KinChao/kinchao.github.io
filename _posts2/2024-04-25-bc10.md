Finished a while ago. Overall an easy-reading book with many interesting stories/ case study about psychology etc.

Additional comments:
------

Ali is a famous youtuber and has loads of videos about stuff like productivity/ personal growth etc. The book is quite good I quite enjoy reading it. Although like other similar books you prob will adopt/ find only 20% or less of the content that is useful. But it's always very interesting to read about case studies/psychological research that has been done etc and what the implications are (Although I have to say I don't usually quite believe in these psychology experiments, it's always fun to learn a bit about them).
