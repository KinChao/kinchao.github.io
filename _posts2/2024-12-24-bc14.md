I am currently reading this, enjoying it so far.

Additional comments:

A beautifully written fiction, again in a memoir-ish style (although not exactly, because this is a fiction book so it's not real etc) which detailed the thinking of the character's thinking etc. I really enjoy this type of memoir-ish book as it allows me to escape into the mind of the main character and I can feel their feeling and thinking etc ... it is an escape into the mind of others.
