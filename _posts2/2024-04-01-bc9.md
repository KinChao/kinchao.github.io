This book is soooo fking good (I think I read this in Yr1/2 just when I needed it the most), so it bonded with me quite strongly. It's like a life lesson book but in a very unconventional manner (but very revealing) and I learn so fking much after reading this. Mark Manson also has a youtube channel and I watch it quite often as well it's very insightful. He also has a new book called Everything is Fucked - it's on my to-read list.
