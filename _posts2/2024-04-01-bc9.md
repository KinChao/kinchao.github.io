This book is soooo fking good (I think I read this when I needed it the most), so it bonded with me quite strongly. It's like a life lessons book and I learn so fking much after reading this. Mark Manson also has a youtube channel and I watch it quite often it's very insightful. He has a new book called Everything is Fucked - it's on my to-read list.
