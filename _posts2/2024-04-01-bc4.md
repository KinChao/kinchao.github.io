I think I read this book in Yr1 - I don't remember much now but I do remember it's quite good. Each chapter is kinda a life lesson on its own. Low-key this book might help shaped some of my decisions during Uni - Definitely read this if you ever feel stuck/ lost in your early 20s or if you are starting uni (in that case you will suddenly have lots of decisions to make yourself, all of which will shape you as who you are in the next couple of years)

Can't remember much now but I remember it did help me quite a lot back then when I was lost in Yr1. Sorry lol.
