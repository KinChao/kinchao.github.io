This book actually helps a lot. I was so just anxious in the ever since I started uni without me realising it (ie base anxiety  level is high). I probably "keep" the anxiety unconsciously because I thought it will help push me forward with the academic side of thing. This book kinda taught me it isn't really the case and it's more beneficial to realise where does the anxiety come from and don't let it to take control. I started reading this book at night when I was just too anxious a couple of days ago - I have now kinda regained a level of calmness which felt really good.

The author has a PhD degree so it isn't just bullshit you etc. I think it's best to read this book in the late evening just before bed. The case study presented is quite interesting and helpful. I think I have a much healthier relationship with anxiety now that I've been reading this book - wish I picked this up earlier maybe during my Yr2.
