This book actually helps a lot. I was so just anxious in the ever since I started uni (aka anxiety base level is high). I probably keep the anxiety unconsciously because I thought it will help push me forward with the academic stuff. This book kinda taught me it isn't really the case. I started reading this book at night when I was just too anxious a couple of days ago - I have now kinda regained a level of calmness and probably get more work done. 

Quick reviews/ thoughts
------

The author has a PhD degree so it isn't just bullshit you etc. I think it's best to read this book in the late even just before sleep. The case study presented is interesting and helpful. I think I have a much healthier relationship with anxiety now that I've been reading this book - wish I picked this up earlier maybe during my Yr2.
