Currently reading, and it has been a very interesting read.

Additional comments:
------

This is not a finance book. It's an autobiography about the life story of a guy who worked very hard etc. The author tells the story of his early life as well as his university life at Oxford (back in the 80s/90s I think, or prob earlier). I love these kinds of books in which we travel in time and learn about the thinking/decisions the author made during his life journey, which might help with your own decision-making as you go through your own journey.
