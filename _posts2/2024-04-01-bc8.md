I think this was the first Fiction book I finished (excluding Harry Potter series) - I missed this book ... Fiction is always a good escape from reality and into the mind and life of the character. The book is medium-level "dense" but I am sure you will find revelations/ your own take-away from the book etc in this book.

I think I read this in Yr2...? (Memory to my naive-self in Yr2)

This is one of those books which will trigger you to think about philosophical Qs like what is the meaning of life etc. It was a goood read. I missed it ...
