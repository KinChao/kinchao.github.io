Oh boy I think this was the first Fiction book I finished (exclude Harry Potter series) I missed it. Fiction is always a good escape from reality into the mind and life of the character. I am sure you will find revelations/ your own take-away from the book etc and everyone is prob different in this book.

Quick reviews/ thoughts

I think I read this in Yr2...?
