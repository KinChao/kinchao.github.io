This is a really well-written and inspiring book — I finished reading it within a week.

In this book, Bill Gates takes us back to his early childhood at Lakeside School in Seattle and shares stories of his personal growth and business adventures during his teenage years, at a time when the computer industry was just beginning to emerge. He also reflects on the friendships that shaped his youth — including the early death of one of his closest friends — how his father, a lawyer, supported him in his business adventures, and how he “gatecrashed” his way into accessing the computer clusters available at the time.

It's very well written — Bill Gates really does know how to write!
