This is more of a semi-autobiography book in which the author take us all the way back and tell us the story of his life in a book. He is not a big figures/ celebrity (not that I am aware of), but more like a ordinary citizen who has quite a dramatic life I'd say (including loss of a child; living with an chronic disease without knowing it for 10 + years etc). He has his own set of believes and values after living his life essentially and in this book I am getting a glimpse into it. 

Additional comments:
------

I would say reading this book probably make me emotionally stronger (probably). It can also be quite philosophical from chapters to chapters including his opinions on e.g. inequality. 

It is one hell of a life that the author has lived.

It's a good book if you want to reflect on your life - by reading about another person's life.
