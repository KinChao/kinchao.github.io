I read most of the books by Malcolm Gladwell he is definitely one of my favourite authors. His book is just so well-written and  a pleasure to read (Prob bc he worked as an journalist back then so the stories in the book are very captivating). This is a must-read for the 10,000 hour rules. I also love his work as he always give loads of real world case-study which is always very fun to read (I love story!).

I read this quite a long time again so can't remember much now. But I remember it's very fun to read, and also quite insightful.
