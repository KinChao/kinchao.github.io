I read most of the books by Malcolm Gladwell he is one of my favourite author. His book is just so well-written and very pleasure to read (Prob bc he worked as an journalist back then). This is a must-read for the 10,000 hour rules. I love his work as he often gave lots of real world case-study which is always fun to read.

I read this quite a long time again so can't remember much now. But I remember it's very fun to read, and also quite insightful.
