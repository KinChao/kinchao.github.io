Highly recommended, a beautifully written memoir about a girl growing up in a chaotic household and how she ended up in her academic career.

Additional comments:

I read this a couple of months ago so can't remember much now. But I do remember it's an extremely well written book (beautiful wordings/ phases etc), with vivid details about her poor/ chaotic childhood with parents who are alcohol and drug addicts. Her growing up journey is also extra-ordinary with many colorful details, she wrote every details and her thought at every stage of her life, and how the encounter of two/ three important people completely changed her life.
