Again highly recommended, a beautifully written memoir detailing Ken's growing up in the US as a TW immigrant and how he cope with/ live with the sudden death of his best friend.

Additional comments:

Again I read this a couple of months ago so can't remember much now. Again lots of details, and thinking etc as Ken details his growing up as a TW immigrant in the US (many details about his family, friends, study etc). There was a tragic "murdering" of his best friend when Ken is around my age, and he wrote about his memories of his best friend in the later half of this book ... which is touching and made me think about his life/ thinking at that stage of life and also made me think about my life etc ... this is also exactly why I started reading memoir lately ... they are often nicely written, and they made me think (self-reflection etc). I enjoyed reading this book.
