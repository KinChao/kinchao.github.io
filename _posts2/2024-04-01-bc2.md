I don't read fiction a lot (although I probably should have read more) but this is the book I am currently reading when I want a brief escape from reality. This book is written in a first-person perspective (which I really like), essentially I am in the mind of the characters when I am inside this book - It is intriguing to go inside the mind of the different characters in the book.

This book is huge. I have finished Book 1 now (1Q84) and currently reading Book 2 (2Q84). One interesting thing about this series is the author basically "switch character" every chapters. E.g. The first chapter is about the world of Tango, second is about Aomame, the third is back to Tango etc. 

Reading fiction allows me to think about how the character lives their lives - I mean I probably will never live the way they live but I enjoy the experience and the thinking while I was there. It is always interesting and fun to get a glimpse into their lives and thoughts whenever I want a escape from reality. 

The book is also very vivid ... (you will know what I mean if you read it)
