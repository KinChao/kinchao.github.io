Education
======
* BSc Chemistry with Medicinal Chemistry and a Year in Industry, Imperial College London, UK (2020-2024)
* International A-levels A* A* A* A A in Chemistry, Maths, Further Maths, Physics and Biology, Yuet Wah College and Chan Sui Ki Perpetual Help College, Macau SAR China (2014-2020)
* IGCSE A* A* A* in Chemistry, Maths and Physics.

Work experience
======
* Multi-Disciplinary Computational Biology industrial placement - UKRI STFC (Aug 2023 - present)
 * Supervisors: Jas Kalayan (MD), James Gebbie-Rayet (HPC) and Joel Greer (EM)
  * Research project developing protocols for MD-based synthetic micrographs pipeline developed by STFC, Rosalind Franklin institute and TU Delft to improve protein heterogeneous reconstruction in cryoEM.
  * Bi-weekly update meeting with direct supervisors, and with project advisors Martyn Winn and Tom Burnley (CCP-EM).
  

* Computational Structural Biology (2022 - present)
  * Supervisors: Sarah Rouse
  * Parasite GAC protein project, co-supervised by Steve Matthews and Marc Morgan (ICL Life Sciences). Protein modelling with coarse-grained MD (CG-MD); steered MD coupled to SAXS; x-ray density refinement using CCP4i2 and COOT. 
  * Mitochondrial protein TgMAF1 and TOM70 project, in collaboration with Lena Pernas (MPI Cologne). Transmembrane protein modelling and dynamics using MODELLER and CG-MD to obtain insight into parasite membrane tethering.
  * Class B1 GPCRs project, in collaboration with Alejandra Tomas (ICL Medicine). Using CG-MD to study lipid modulations by membrane environment, and using AT-MD to obtain insight into SUMOylation and palmitoylation in GLP-1R.
  * B1AR GPCR project, in collaboration with Carol Robinson (Oxford Chemistry). Modelling of ICL3 loop and using CG-MD and AT-MD to investigate the effect of ICL3 on MiniGas orientation.
  

* Experimental Structural Biology (Aug 2022 - June 2023)
  * CryoEM shadowing (supervised by PDRA Joe Barritt, Rouse lab) – theories and operation of the two microscopes in the department; cryoEM processing using RELION.
  * Protein purification shadowing (supervised by PDRA Grace Wu, Matthews lab) – recombinant protein expression and purification process from transformation, incubation, affinity purification, size exclusion chromatography.
  
  
Summer research
======
* Computational Biochemistry UROP (summer 2022)
  * Primary supervisor: Sarah Rouse. Secondary supervisor: Ed Tate Project title: "Rational design of synthetic cardiolipin analogues" A blue-skies, collaborative project, aimed at generating preliminary data. Keywords: CG-MD, cardiolipin analogue. This project exposed me to biomolecular simulations.

* Computational Biology UROP (summer 2021)
  * Supervised by Sarah Rouse. Project title: Towards building a mitochondrial interactome knowledge graph (KG). Keywords: Vaticle TypeDB and TypeQL coding, python, uniprot Contributed to a collaboration with the US company Vector Space Biosciences. Featured in this [news](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/234034/ai-life-sciences-research-gets-boost/).

* Digital Chemistry UROP (summer 2021)
  * Digital Chemistry summer project based Imperial College Advanced Hackspace in White City. Keywords: soldering, wiring, circuit design, Arduino IDE, python, Fusion360, laser cutting, 3D printing.
