Welcome to Kin Chao (also known as Rain Chao; or street name Rå‘¨)'s research and personal website.

I am currently doing a computational chemistry internship in [AstraZeneca](https://www.astrazeneca.com/our-company/our-locations/cambridge.html) in Cambridge. Previously I finished a 1-year research placement in the [Scientific Computing Department](https://www.scd.stfc.ac.uk/Pages/home.aspx) at UKRI STFC (2023-2024), doing a bit of MD simulations and computational cryoEM. I also have active computational structural biology research projects in [Sarah Rouse's](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/s.rouse/page/bio.html) lab in the Department of Life Sciences at Imperial College London (2 Years +). Previously I finished my BSc degree in Medicinal Chemistry also at Imperial College London (2020-2023).

I will be joining [Jon Essex's](https://essexgroup.soton.ac.uk/) group in September 2024 at the University of Southampton on a computational project for [PROTAC](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41573-021-00371-6) optimisation, joinly funded by University of Southampton and AstraZeneca.

My research interest lies in the use of computational approaches in the field of medicinal chemistry and biochemistry. Key interested areas including: 
1. Computational Structural Biology: From using "larger" scale coarse-grained MD simulations to study protein-lipid interaction and receptors oligomerisation behaviour; to "smaller" scale atomistic MD to obtain molecular insights.
1. Computational Chemistry: Interested in various computational chemistry techniques used in a drug discovery context.
1. I have loads of other academic interests but never able to find the time and energy to explore in-depth (should have more time and energy during PhD... hopefully )



I have enjoyed a few fruitful collaborations with experimental groups for my many research projects in the Rouse Lab duing my UG so far. I have developed a keen interest in MD simulations and the structural insights they offer, and how these insights can be used to provide additional molecular understanding as well as to guide experimental design. The former case includes collaborations with [Steve Matthews](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/s.j.matthews) (ICL Life Sciences) to study the parasite protein TgGAC (published in [eLife](https://elifesciences.org/articles/86049)) and with [Carol Robinson](https://www.chem.ox.ac.uk/people/dame-carol-robinson) (Oxford Chemistry) to investigate the effect of the ICL3 loop on b1ar coupling and activation (submitted to JACS). The latter case involves using cgMD simulations to identify cholesterol binding sites and binding modes in GLP-1R, allowing the informed selection of 12 residues for a mutagenesis study by our experimental collaborator [Alejandra Tomas](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/a.tomas-catala) (ICL Medicine) (published in [BioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.06.22.600087v2)). I am very happy to see that my work contributed to the preliminary MD data in a successful [Wellcome Trust grant](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/251975/wellcome-trust-discovery-grant-advance-therapies/).


I also have a strong interest in guiding and mentoring ambitious UG students who are interested in navigating a scientific career. I myself struggled really hard back in my Year 1 and Year 2 in my UG due to various reasons including moving to a new city with different languages, covid, and uncertainty about the future etc, and I really wished there was someone to guide me back then. Now that I am on the other side I am happy to give back and to train/ guide the next gen UG students (from Macau) who are interested in sciences/ research-based career. Please reach out if you are interested.
