Welcome to Kin Chao (also known as Rain Chao; or street name Rå‘¨)'s research and personal website

I am currently doing a 1-year research placement in the [Scientific Computing Department](https://www.scd.stfc.ac.uk/Pages/home.aspx) at UKRI STFC, doing a bit of MD simulations and computational cryoEM. I also have very active Computational Biochemistry research projects in [Sarah Rouse's](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/s.rouse/page/bio.html) lab in the Department of Life Sciences at Imperial College London (2 Years +). Previously I finished my BSc degree in Medicinal Chemistry also at Imperial College London.


My research interet lies in the use of computational approaches in the field of medicinal chemistry and biochemistry. Key interested areas including: 
1. MD simulations: "Larger" scale coarse-grained MD simulations to study protein-lipid interaction and receptros oligomerisation behaviour/ membrane organisation; "Smaller" scale atomistic MD including e.g. ligand binding, free energy calculation.
1. Bioinformatics: The use of computational and systematic approach to Biology, and data-science framework including integration of multi-omics data. Particular interst in studying GPCRs signalling pathway and biased agonism.
1. Drug Dsicovery: Interested in various computational techniques including e.g. virtural screening, structure-based drug discovery, medicinal chemistry, ML/AI techniques.

My previous 2 years + research in Rouse Lab has really only been looking at the "larger" scale cgMD simulations to study receptor-lipid interactions. I expect to explore other areas of interest during my Master's and PhD studies in the next couple of years.

I have enjoyed a few fruitful colloborations with experimental groups for my many research projects in the Rouse Lab so far. I have developed a keen interest in MD simulations and the structural insights they offer, and how these insights can be used to provide additional molecular understanding as well as to guide experimental design. The former case includes collaborations with [Steve Matthews](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/s.j.matthews) (ICL Life Sciences) to study the parasite protein TgGAC (published in [eLife](https://elifesciences.org/articles/86049)) and with [Carol Robinson](https://www.chem.ox.ac.uk/people/dame-carol-robinson) (Oxford Chemistry) to investigate the effect of the ICL3 loop on b1ar coupling and activation (submitted to PNAS). The latter case involves using cgMD simulations to identify cholesterol binding sites and binding modes in GLP-1R, allowing the informed selection of 12 residues for a mutagenesis study by our experimental collaborator [Alejandra Tomas](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/a.tomas-catala) (ICL Medicine) (in preparation for eLife). My work also contributed to the preliminary MD data in a successful [Wellcome Trust grant](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/251975/wellcome-trust-discovery-grant-advance-therapies/).

I also have a strong interest in guiding and mentoring ambitious UG students who are interested in navigating a scientific career from Macau. I myself struggled really hard back in my Year 1 and Year 2 in my UG due to various reasons including moving to a new city with different languages, covid, and uncertainty about the future etc, and I really wished there was someone to guide me back then. Now that I am on the other side I am happy to give back and to train/ guide the next gen UG students (from Macau) who are interested in sciences/ research-based career. Please reach out if you are interested.
