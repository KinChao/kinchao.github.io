About
-------

All of the currently existing Macau-UK society is focused on making friends and having fun. However, there exists a demand for a community for ambitious Macanese undergraduate students who wish to make the most out of their UK undergraduate studies and foster skills for a science/research-related career. I aim to create a community to allow intellectual growth, exchange of ideas, and create a safe space for members to practice skills that are necessary for a research-based career.

I am currently looking for potential co-founder and member to join! Please get in touch with me if you are interested. (IG: rain_chao_ or WhatsApp: +44 7311 777131)

We will be hosting regular meetings where each participant will have an opportunity to present a literature review, a selected paper, or a research area of interest in English. Our aim is to foster a friendly environment where everyone is encouraged to delve deeper into their field of interest and to practice scientific presentations.
