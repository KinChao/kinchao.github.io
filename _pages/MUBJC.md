About
-------

The Macau-UK Biomedical Journal Club is finally up and rolling! Co-founded by myself, Ashley Wong, and Brandon Ma in November 2024, this club provides a platform for discussions in the wide field of "biomed". We meet every Friday at 4 PM and each week one of us gives a talk about something cool or interesting from their field.

The schedule (tentative) is listed below. If you’d like to join or learn more, please feel free to contact me!

Invited Career talk by Quang Le : [Recording link](https://youtu.be/c4gV8Uka3qo)
-------

We’re very excited to welcome Dr. Quang Le for a special career talk, where he’ll share insights from his journey across bioinformatics, computer science, academia, and industry.

Quang is a highly experienced bioinformatician and software engineer, currently working as a Senior Software Engineer at Meta. He spent around 10 years in academia as a postdoctoral researcher and research fellow, with positions inclduing at the University of Portsmouth, University of Oxford and Wellcome Sanger Institute. For the past 10 years, he has worked in industry, holding roles at major organisations including Google and JPMorgan before moving to Meta.

In this talk, Quang will share personal stories that reflect on his career path, key decisions, and what he might have done differently in hindsight. He will also discuss the challenges, lessons, and insights he has gained from his time in both academia and industry.

You can find out more about Quang's work from his [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/quangsile/?originalSubdomain=uk) and [google scholar profile](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=Q7Q-7f8AAAAJ&hl=en).
