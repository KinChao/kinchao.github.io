With one month away from finishing my current placement (I'm taking a 3-week + holiday in June), two months away from AZ internship, and five months away from starting MPhil, I find myself in a reflective state this week and it's clear that change is imminent on many levels.

Longing for the new
------

When I said "New place, new subject, new people, and college life" in the last post there's actually some emotional elements behind my longing for a new start (I only realised later). It kinda triggered me into reflecting my placement year 

Lots of ups and downs ... I think I grew a lot during this year, but still trying to find my place in this world. Some believes and values are changed, I started questioning about what I really want recently, and come to the conclusion that change is imminent (for good or for bad) - I might become a different person next year when I look back..

Life moves on.

New start !
